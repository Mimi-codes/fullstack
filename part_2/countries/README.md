I learnt how to:

- Fetch countries data from rest countries api endpoint (provides data for different countries in a machine-readable format, a so-called REST API.) using axios
- This app shows countries by typing a search query into the search field.
- If there are too many (over 10) countries that match the query, then the user is prompted to make their query more specific
- If there are ten or fewer countries, but more than one, then all countries matching the query are shown:
- Display the countries weather details from openweathermap.org endpoint
- how to use .env file and api keys
